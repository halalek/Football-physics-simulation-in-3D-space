# Football-physics-simulation-in-3D-space
This project aims to study the movement of a football within a room to simulate the ball colliding with the wall, its bounce, its rotation, and the study of ball throwing using Opengl.

## Physical laws used:
-Newton's first law

-Newton's second law

-Newton's third law

-Friction 

-Rotational movement of the ball

-Collision

-Speed after collision

-Throwing

## Ball cases:
### 1-The ball is at rest on the green grass, meaning its speed is constant and equal to zero
### 2-Ideal case:
If we were playing football in space, the ball would move at a constant speed after the kick, and because friction was very little, the ball would continue at the same speed for a huge distance, theoretically to infinity.
### 3-Normal state:
When we kick the ball hard, its speed increases in a short period from zero to maximum speed, so it is said that its acceleration is great after the kick. The force that was applied no longer affects it and the ball’s acceleration stops. On the other hand, the force of air friction, and then the friction with the green grass, affects the ball in the opposite direction, causing the ball to slow down and decrease its speed to zero.
### 4-throwing:
When we kick the ball at a certain angle in the air
We notice the flight of the ball in the air, in addition to the path it forms in the form of an arc.
### 5-Collision:
To detect a collision between a ball and a wall, a ball and a wall are considered to have collided if the distance between the center of the ball and the closest point to the wall is smaller or equal to the radius of the ball.

The recoil speed after the impact is equal to the speed before the impact, but it is the same (in the opposite direction) with respect to the axis. The kinetic energy is also the same and is represented by the following:
𝑃_𝑏𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟=𝑚×𝑣×𝑥
𝑃_𝑎𝑓𝑡𝑒𝑟=𝑚×𝑣×−𝑥=−𝑚×𝑣×𝑥
